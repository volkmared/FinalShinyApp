# FinalShinyApp
Final individual shiny app project for BAS 475

This project is for BAS475 at UTK. 
The purpose of this application is to plot and analyze time series data for the souvenirs data set in fpp3. Plots are divided up into four sections: Descriptions, Simple Models, Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA. Corresponding plots are shown in each of these tabs according to the label. Select a tab to view plots for the souvenirs data set. Follow additional instructions on tabs if necessary."

For the "Descriptions" tab, four models are displayed with descriptions of the time series. 
"Simple Models" displays models for the app. 
"Exponential Smoothing" displays Holt's and Holt's/Winters' models.
ARIMA displays manually selected and automatic ARIMA models.
